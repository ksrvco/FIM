File Integrity Monitoring for linux based servers that using systemd

# About :
One of the important issues in increasing the security factor of systems and systems in different centers and places is to use the concepts of File Integrity Monitoring. File integrity monitoring means that we know the sensitive and important files of our services and our servers and constantly monitor them so that we can be informed if an unusual situation occurs in them. For example, abnormal status means that if a change is made in the passwd file of the Linux server in an abnormal way, we can be informed and understand that a user name has been created illegally in the server. This concept can help us to be able to act in time against the attacks and intrusions made to the server and take the next steps. Writing such tools is simple. But considering that I am interested in writing tools, I coded this tool in such a way that it can be started as a service on Linux servers. Also, this tool is able to save the logs related to these errors so that other checks can be done later. He did on them.
